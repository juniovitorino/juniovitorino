### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a hands-on software developer with almost two decades of experience.
I worked for the major industries developing web, mobile, and IoT using mostly Ruby, PHP, JavaScript, Elixir, and C++.
I share my days between software engineering and engineering management for homeland and international companies.
